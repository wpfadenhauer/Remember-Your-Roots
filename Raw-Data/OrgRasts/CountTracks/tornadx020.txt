  Description: 
    Abstract: 
      This map layer shows tornado touchdown points in the United States, Puerto 
      Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, from 1950 to 2008.  Statistical data 
      were obtained from the National Weather Service, Storm Prediction Center 
      (SPC).  The SPC data originate from the Severe Thunderstorm Database and 
      the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Data 
      publication.  This is an updated version of the September 2005 map layer.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Weather Service or the 
      National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data. 
    Supplemental_Information: 
      This map layer represents an edited version of the information available, 
      in ASCII format, from the SPC page at <http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/>.  The 
      SPC data set contains additional attributes, more information on tornadoes 
      that affected multiple States, and additional tornadoes that were deleted 
      from this map layer due to attribution problems.
      
      Historical tornado data are also available in the SPC's Historical Tornado
      Data Archive <http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/historical.html>.

      Process_Description:
        ASCII text files, in Comma Seperated Values (CSV) format, of tornado 
        statistics for the years 2005 to 2008 were downloaded from the NOAA -    
        National Weather Service - Storm Prediction Center and imported into 
        Excel and exported out in dBase (dbf) format.  The dBase files were 
        converted to shapefiles, in ArcCatalog, using the Longitude and 
        Latitude data to create x and y coordinate points.    The shapefiles 
        were loaded into ArcMap and the attribute table was restructured to 
        meet National Atlas specifications using the Table Restucture tool     
        in XTools 5.2.0 Table Operations.  The restructured 2005 – 2008 
        tornado shapefile was merged with ATLAS-TOR04. Continuation records 
        without latitude and longitude were deleted, as were records where 
        latitude and longitude were 0.0.  Records were deleted for ten 
        tornadoes with touchdown points that fell in Canada, Mexico, the 
        ocean, or Lake Michigan.  For tornadoes that affected several States, 
        the records with State information were deleted, but the records with 
        full-path information were retained.  Fields were converted from 
        decimal values to integers where appropriate, and several typographic 
        errors were corrected.  Unnecessary attribute fields were deleted.  
        The numeric State FIPS code was recalculated as a string and the 
        values for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were corrected.  
        A final shapefile was created.

        The length of the tornado track in tenths of a statute mile (146 = 14.6 
        miles).   Tracks may be nonlinear, so the length may not be the same as 
        the great-circle distance from the touchdown point to the lift-off
        point.

      Attribute_Definition: 
        For tornadoes prior to 1994, the mean tornado path width in tens of feet 
        (528.00 = 5280.0 feet or 1 mile.)  This is the mean width along the 
        entire track.  The minimum width is assumed to be 30 feet.  A width was 
        computed for each State that a tornado affected, and the mean was 
        calculated from those values.

        For tornadoes from 1994 and later, the maximum width in tens of feet.
